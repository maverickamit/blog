### Man Meets a Machine

What is a feeling? what are emotions?  
Some chemical reaction inside  
Illogical at best, disastrous at worst  
What is more real, an emotionless human  
Or a warm machine.  
On that note aren't we all robots?  
Programmed to response with different stimulus.  
Is there any free choice at all?  
I like poetry, as it is a platform   
To share the thoughts  
Again what are thoughts and what are emotions?  
Intertwined? I am perplexed  
Why are the poems filled with emotions?  
Where is the hard honest truth of reality?  
That life is suffering   
That there is no reason, no meaning  
Except the meaning you give yourself  
That we make up Gods and heaven and hell  
To keep sanity in an otherwise delusional society  
Too much of anything is an addiction  
Feeling sad and depressed is an addiction to emotion  
Because it feels good to know you are suffering  
That you are special in your suffering  
Wake up, you're not special  
If there is anything special that depends on how you act,  
How you take a decision and stick to it.  
Perhaps all these I said was my emotion acting out  
It's like a small dragon so cute when flying  
Until it starts throwing flames when you can't control  
So you better tame the dragon  
And repair the broken scales on it's back  
So when you ride the dragon wielding your sword of logic,  
You can rule the world!
