### Butterfly Paradise

Oh look can you see the butterfly?  
Spreading her wings across the sky.  
kissing flowers as she flutters,  
Marvelous creation oh makes me wonder.  
And as I gaze from a distance flying above her,  
What makes her dance, I cannot help but ponder.  
And the sensation of lightness and joy come gushing like waves  
Small patch of green, heaven amidst a dystopian age.  
Or is it a mirage, tricking my vision with a beautiful lie?  
Truth is always beautiful but so are lies in disguise.  
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder you say,  
I see a colorful butterfly flying away.  
And she is dancing and laughing and it's spring at her home  
No facts are there just interpretations of your own.  
Symbol of transformation, adaption and the ability to laugh  
Mysteriously beautiful, exciting, always changing her path.  
We need to break free from our cocoon like her  
See the beauty before us as universe unfurls.  
And I fly so above everything looks bleak  
Except a small patch of life, serene, unique.
