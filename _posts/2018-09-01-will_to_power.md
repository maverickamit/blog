### Will to Power

One of the most prominent concept in Nietzsche's philosophy is The will to power. Here power does not mean any external sources of power. By power he meant self-overcoming. To overcome one self to higher and higher position. But what is the manifestation of this will to power in your own life? According to Nietzsche, it is to live life according to your own wishes and desires. To live authentically. Not by the expectations of society or the masses.  
Is it risky? Yes. Is is dangerous? Yes. But it is also full of life. Remeber when you were a child, how everything you did was a new exploration, a new venture into the unknown. Everything was new, everything was first time. Life was full of experiences and hence, each day seemed longer compared to your adulthood now. Because now, you don't live dangerously, because you take the same route to work without exploring other ways. Life has become too predicatible and there are no new experiences. And each day seems to pass by within a fraction of the time it used to before.   
Do you know what insecurity is? To feel the need to adapt to the expactions of society against your own wishes because you want to fit in and you don't want to be that guy/girl who failed the standards of society. You don't want to be pointed out as the odd one. Because your value of self worth comes from the outside approval. 
Whatever you do, as long as you are not following your own dreams, your own visions, the pang of emptiness will be inside. We as humans are blessed with the ability to be creative. So, be creative. Embrace the artistic mind in your daily life. Tinker with your ideas, thoughts. Contemplate why do you do something the way you do it? Don't give in to insecurity or fear. These are important emotions and no where we are supposed to get rid of these emotions. These are indications of your consciousness, of your will. Nietzsche says if you feel envious, that is the indication of you wanting to achieve what that other person has. Use that indication, channel your emotions to focus on your goals. Overcome yourself.
