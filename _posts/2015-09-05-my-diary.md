### My Diary

The chaos of my feelings  
The numbness of the sense  
Scattered thoughts everywhere  
All scripted in this page  
Every day and every night  
All the dreams that haunt or smile  
Come alive again and again  
Through your words and writing style  
Listen to the stories of a puzzled boy  
Who didn't care for anyone except you  
You are my diary, come inside and take a view  
Many pages many places few people knew  
And I'll keep going on and on  
Making blank pages turn into song  
And you'll be another diary of my life  
Forever taking care of my secrets along.
