## Open and See

Have you ever noticed the cool breeze,  
Blowing slowly   
All over your body, across your face  
Taking that drop of sweat with it  
And giving back a bliss of comfort  
You don't.  
Just like the ever presence flow of love from your well-wishers  
Takes away the lump of pain from you and give you back a sense of belonging  
A gift of understanding in midst of this unforgiving world,  
forever forgiving your shortcomings with compassion.  
No, instead you notice the storm, the wind that blows everything away.  
And you notice the absence of it on a scorching hot summer day  
Why do you notice the conflicted dramas and the numbing silences  
But never the cool, calm breeze  
Is it because, when you look at the mirror  
You see a bottomless pit instead of a human  
And the storm gives you reason to look away   
So you beg for the storms, you wish for the pain from outside  
And in turn gradually drowning in the pit yourself  
No wonder it's dark in here, because your eyes are closed.  
Now it's time to open and see.
