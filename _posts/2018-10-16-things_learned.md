### The best things I learned from my girlfriend

Well, it seems to me in this era of romanticism, we make the bar of expectations pretty high from our partners. In reality, we forget even the little small things they do for us is a gift, every time. It's all good and well to have an idealistic vision of love and relationships but the reality is much less dramatic, lots of compromises and very hard to hold on to. Many soon give up or blame others for not being able grasp and accept the reality. But if personal growth is what you're looking for, one of the best teacher in life could be your relationship. From parents to siblings to partners and your friends. But most from your romantic relationship, because perhaps that is where we are least exposed to but expect the most from. It is always by jumping into the water, you learn to swim.
Having said that, here are a couple of things I am grateful for and the things she made me understand about myself and the world. 
1. I learned how to see the positive side of people and to not judge them too harshly. For a cynic like myself who used to find the flaws in someone's personality at first, it has helped me a lot to be more optimistic about life and people.   

2. To learn how to trust and give your love without worrying about being wronged.  
Trusting doesn't come to me naturally, but she has taught me to be trusting by being an example in my life. Even when I didn't act as a trustworthy person, she continued to trust me. And I learned the value of not succumbing to my fears.
    
3. To learn to stop wanting to control everything and everyone around me.  
I was pretty arrogant during my childhood. As arrogant as they come. And my ego soared high above the skies. But she brought it down to the ground. And showed me my mistakes, in my way of thinking that I have the best solution to every question. No one else confronted me as much as her and I'm grateful for being shown the errors in my way of life. She took the time and effort to point it out to me. 

4. Last but not the least, to learn to celebrate every day the small but beautiful things that happens and to find humor in everyday life. Her liveliness and full of enthusiasm about the smallest things has helped me to stop thinking always and to feel more authentically, to live in the present moment.
