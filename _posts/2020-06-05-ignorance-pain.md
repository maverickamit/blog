## Ignorance is pain

A teardrop in her eye,  
Tired walk on a lonely road,  
She stops every other step,  
To check back for a stranger.

Brief relief from fear,  
From being always on guard  
Maybe the stranger is gone  
But she can never be sure.

A long time ago,  
It was a sunny bright day,  
The birds were talking with her,  
The flowers were smiling wide.

Oh look how lovely she is,  
Exclaimed the neighbours,  
And their kids rushed to her,  
To play along.

And then it happened,  
The stranger came,  
In a split moment with a red eye,  
Taking away her laughter.

It was pain all around,  
And she's been running since,  
Away from the pain,  
Away from people.

Wake up; it's time to work.  
Daily struggle, another day.  
How real was my dream?  
Where's the girl, do I know her?

Perhaps I was her all along,  
Living a life of ignorance,  
But there is no stranger after me,  
Only my shadow, the dark self.
