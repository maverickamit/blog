### Why Just Listen, When You Can Dance

Out of dancing stars we are born. And in the lights of fireflies we depart. In the space between, where is the meaning of life? Is it in the hopes of achieving what you can never achieve? Or is it only a struggle to live, and to live well by all means. Little is our planet, microscopic are our lives. Yet, they mean the whole world to us. We cling on to life like a baby clings on to motherâ€™s breast. And those who fail to hope are treated so they can hope again. Surely, hope is the best of all things but the same hope can be the evilest of all things to prolong your pain.   
Perhaps life has no meaning at all. It is upto you, whatever you choose it to be. Like all the Gods we made, our life is a dream too. A dream we choose to live everyday. And dreams are nothing but fragments of reality sewed together in a hurry by a kid. And it is as real as you want it to be. So why just sit and listen to life, when you can dance with it.
