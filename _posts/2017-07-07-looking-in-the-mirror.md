# Looking in the Mirror

Walking alone in the winter night
With a frozen heart and a heavy soul.
My mind was wandering to the distant thoughts,
Who am I really? what am I here for?
Leaving crumbs of past on my way
I was walking forward to the end.
A stray dog was following me closely behind,
Or was it a monster I can't recall.
But it was burning inside, a little fire to keep me warm
And I knew sunlight is ahead, even if I couldn't see through the fog.
And now I'll tell you my friends, it was with me all along
Only I opened my eyes as I was dreaming a nightmare of my own.
