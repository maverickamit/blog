# Momentary Ecstasies

The weather was perfect. It just rained a little ago. You could still feel the humidity in the air. The sky was clear now and the gloomy sun was on his way to the other side of the earth.  
She was sitting beside me, hands on her knees. The steps we sat on descended into the water. Little waves made splashes that formed ripples around our toes. You could hear the sound of water smashing against the concrete. Few kids were playing a few yards away.   
I looked at her. She started fiddling with her hair. “What are you thinking?” She asked.  
“The river.”  
“What about the river?”  
“What do you see in front of you Arti?”  
“River, boat, sunset, birds.. what do you mean?” She looked confused, trying to guess my motive.  
“I see life. Don't you think the constant flow of river represents life? See how it just keeps flowing, regardless of how many obstacles came it's way. either it takes a new route or destroys the obstacle.”  
“You're right about that. But what about death? Every life ends at one point. But the river keeps flowing, forever.”  
“Yeah, death, end...” I paused for a moment. “It's going to end one day, isn't it? You and me.”  
“Is that the worst thing? We value and savour each moment because of it. Death is beautiful. Life without death is meaningless.”  
I knew she was right but I couldn't accept that so easily like her. Sure, Death is inevitable,and nothing lasts forever, but shouldn't we fight against that? isn't that what living is about, to make it last forever while enjoying every moment of it. Life is about the hope for future. Wanting to see tomorrow. Dreaming and going after your dreams.   
“I just want to capture this moment with you, this feeling, all the happiness, forever in my memory”, she said while she leaned against my shoulder and  grabbed my hand to wrap it around her neck.  
“Why are you smiling? she asked me.   
“Nothing”, I avoided getting too emotional about it. But I didn't know myself why was I smiling like a fool. Is it because of her? I guess it was. Though I knew she wasn't the one and only source of my happiness, she was a big reason of it. Sure we are happy by ourselves, but what is happiness when it is not shared with someone? I wanted to share my happiness with her and that was why I was smiling like a fool.  
Now she was getting impatient with this all these silence from me. I didn't even have to look, I knew it.   
“Come on!! let's walk. I don't want to sit anymore."  
That how she was, full of energy and impatient. It was getting dark anyway, so I agreed to her. She sprung ahead of me, and walking like a kid, dancing along the way, while singing a tune of one of her favourite song.  
“Watch where you're going”, I shouted from behind. But didn’t look like she heard my voice.   
“Look at that! Aren't those beautiful Ajay? Give me those!”  
“No”, I replied.   
It were a bunch of wildflowers alongside the promenade.   
“Please...”, I tried to resist her puppy dog eyes stare but to no avail.  
“Here! happy now?” I plucked one for her.  
Her face was beaming with happiness. Such a small gesture but she was always moved by these.  
“Let's go back to home now”. I grabbed her hand firmly this time.
